# ES6 Modules Cat Clicker

A simple cat clicker inspired by [JavaScript Design Patterns](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-design-patterns--ud989) Udacity's course.

This web app is developed in pure JavaScript with use of new feature of ES6 modules and webpack. It make use of CSS Flexbox and Grid. 

There is also a KnockOut.js version of the same web app.

You can checkout [ES6](https://projects.kantas.net/catClicker/) and [KO](https://projects.kantas.net/catClicker/KO/) versions.

*ES6 modules, webpack, flexbox and grid are my experiments and not part of Udacity's Course*
